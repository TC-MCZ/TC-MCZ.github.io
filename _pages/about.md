#### Welcome to Chengzhen Mengâ€™s Homepage! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a final-year PhD student under the supervision of Professor [Yanyongâ€¯Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yanyongz/) at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), expecting to graduate in 2026. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021. My research primarily focuses on mmWave sensing, radarâ€“camera fusion, LiDARâ€“camera automatic calibration, SLAM, and robust place recognition.

Iâ€™m a sporty and energetic guy who enjoys staying active. Table tennis and badminton are my favorite pastimesâ€”I love the excitement, speed, and rhythm they bring.

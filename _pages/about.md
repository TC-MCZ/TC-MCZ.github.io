#### Welcome to Chengzhen Mengâ€™s Homepage! ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Professor [Yanyongâ€¯Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yanyongz/), and expect to graduate in 2026. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021. My research interests include mmWave sensing, radarâ€“camera fusion, and UAV tracking.

I'm full of energy and love staying active. Table tennis and badminton are my favoritesâ€”I enjoy their fast pace and the fun they bring.
